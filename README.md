# DemoSQLInjection
A C# example of what NOT to do for SQL Injection

# Be Kind
I am a C / C++ developer writing C#.  This may have ugly / nonstandard C#.  If you point out kindly, I will update.

# Info
This Program has the write way to write SQL statements (Paramatized) and the *wrong* way.

You'll  need to update the config.json to match your database.  And then make a copy in the exe directory.  (bin/debug)
